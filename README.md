# Timeline: A Year Of 'Systemic Failure' At DCF

A page built using the [app-template](https://github.com/vprnet/app-template).

## Set Up

1. Install [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
2. Clone the repository

        $ git clone git@github.com:vprnet/interactive-transcript-gov-peter-schumlins-third-inaugral-address.git

3. Create Virtual Environment in project

        $ cd interactive-transcript-gov-peter-schumlins-third-inaugral-address
        $ virtualenv venv

4. Enter virtual environment

        $ source venv/bin/activate

5. Install requirements

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Copy `_config.py` as `config.py`

        $ cp main/_config.py main/config.py

  These settings can be configured later (see "Deploy" below)

7. Install grunt modules ([read this](http://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/) if getting started with Grunt)

        $ cd main/static
        $ npm install

## Downloading the Video Files

In order to not have the large video files w/ the audio checked into the repo,
you must download them from AWS S3.

- MP4: http://www.vpr.net/apps/interactive-transcript-gov-peter-shumlins-third-inaugural-address/static/video/video.mp4
- Webm: http://www.vpr.net/apps/interactive-transcript-gov-peter-shumlins-third-inaugural-address/static/video/video.webm

Place them in the `main/static/video/` directory.

##Develop

To get grunt running in the background:

        $ cd main/static
        $ grunt

To run local server, get back to project root and run:

        $ python runserver.py

The project will be viewable at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Deploy

1. In config, set the `AWS_DIRECTORY` to either `sandbox/timeline-dcf-systemic-failure/` or `apps/timeline-dcf-systemic-failure/`

2. Configure AWS settings in `config.py`

4. Freeze files and push to S3

        $ python runserver.py freeze
